# 🌐 Web Automation & Scraping using Selenium & JUnit

This project is built using **Selenium WebDriver** and **JUnit** in **Java** to automate two webforms and perform data scraping.

- ✅ The first webform, the **Practice Webform for Learners**, involves filling out all fields, uploading a file, and verifying the success message after submission.  
- ✅ The second webform, the **Guest Registration Form**, automates the process of entering the required information, accepting terms and conditions, and asserting successful registration.  
- ✅ The third task scrapes data from the **DSE Latest Share Price Table**, prints the data in the console, and stores it in a `.txt` file.
